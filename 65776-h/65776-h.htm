<p>This field book is intended to guide beginners
in their collection and general
classification of plant fossils. It illustrates
the plant fossils most commonly
found in Illinois and relates them to the
plants of which they were a part. A list
of publications that will furnish more detailed
identification of specimens is included. The book
has been prepared in response to numerous inquiries
to the Illinois State Geological Survey
from amateur collectors.</p>
<p>Information has been drawn from numerous
sources. The works of Hirmer, Janssen, Lesquereux,
No&eacute;, and Langford have been particularly
useful.</p>
<p>We are especially indebted to Dr. Robert
M. Kosanke, paleobotanist at the Illinois State
Geological Survey, and Dr. Wilson N. Stewart,
professor of botany of the University of Illinois,
for helpful suggestions and use of their libraries.</p>

<p>Plants that flourished 200 million years ago
have made Illinois one of the best known fossil
collecting sites in the world. The unusual abundance
and preservation of these fossils in the
northern part of the state have brought collectors
to Illinois from many countries, and prized specimens
from that area may be seen in science museums throughout
the world.</p>
<p>The remarkable fossils represent plants that lived
during the geologic period called the Pennsylvanian or
Coal Age and are the result of special geologic conditions
that occurred repeatedly during the period.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Pennsylvanian Period, Illinois
was part of a vast lowland that stretched for hundreds of
miles to the north, south, and west, and was bordered on
the east by highlands. At times much of the plain was
swampy and, because the climate was relatively warm
and moist, great jungles of fast growing trees, shrubs,
and vines covered the landscape. As successive generations
of plants lived and died, plant material fell into the
swamp waters and, protected there from decay, accumulated.</p>
<p>Frequently during the period, seas spread over the
swampy lowlands, submerging the forests and covering
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
them with mud. Each submergence lasted only a short
time, geologically speaking. When the seas withdrew,
the deposits of sand and mud left behind were cut by
streams that carried fresh sand and mud from the eastern
highlands. The streams eventually became clogged with
sediments and when the lowland was again depressed
swamp conditions returned and forests grew afresh. Such
a cycle of deposition was repeated again and again during
Pennsylvanian time, and after burial each layer of plant
material gradually lost most of its liquids and gases and
was slowly converted into one of the numerous coal beds
presently found in Illinois.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="pcap">Reconstruction of Pennsylvanian Coal-forming Swamp</p>
</div>
<p>In some places in the state conditions existed that
were especially favorable for preservation of plants, and
there delicately preserved fossils are found in great numbers.
In the most favorable areas, such as in northern
Illinois, the plants are preserved in stony nodules called
concretions, but they also may be found separately as
molds, casts, or petrifactions.</p>
<p>Molds (concave surfaces) and casts (convex surfaces)
are fossilization phenomena in which the actual
plant, embedded in the surrounding background rock, was
dissolved, leaving a hollow space (mold) that subsequently
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
filled with other material. A cast was thus formed
that preserved the plant&rsquo;s external features.</p>
<p>Most petrifactions are fossils in which silica, carbonate,
or other material permeated or replaced the internal
structures of the plant and preserved them so well
that in most specimens the finest cellular details can be
observed. Compressions, another kind of petrifaction,
are the pressed carbonized remains of the plant itself.</p>

<p>The far-reaching Pennsylvanian swamplands had abundant
species of trees and other plants that long since
have become extinct. Today&rsquo;s
common deciduous trees were
not present; flowering plants
had not yet evolved. Instead,
the tangled forests were dominated
by giant ancestors of
presently existing club-mosses,
horsetails, ferns, conifers, and
cycads. The undergrowth also
was well developed, consisting
mainly of ferns, fernlike plants,
<i>Sphenophyllum</i>, and small club-mosses.
The plant fossils give no indication of seasonal
variations. The forests,
evidently always green, grew rapidly
and abundantly, with foliage
of unprecedented size and luxuriance.
Land animals were just
beginning to develop and included
sluggish, salamander-like amphibians,
large primitive insects,
and a few small reptiles. The insects
flourished as never before
or since in the damp forests and
attained remarkable size. Insects
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
more than four inches long were common and some are
known to have been more than a foot long with a wingspread
proportionately broad. Ancestors of the modern
spiders, scorpions, centipedes (one fossil found in Illinois
was twelve inches long), cockroaches, and dragonflies
are represented by several hundred species.</p>
<p>The fossilized plants of Pennsylvanian time belonged
to only a few main categories: scale and seal trees, ancient
scouring rushes (horsetails), herbaceous <i>Sphenophyllum</i>,
ferns, seed ferns, and cordaitean trees.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">SCALE AND SEAL TREES</span>
<br />(<a href="#fig15">Plate 1</a>)</h2>
<p>Scale and seal trees
were abundant during the
Pennsylvanian Period and
were important contributors
to coal beds. Although distantly
related to the diminutive
club-mosses and ground
pines of the present, the
trees grew on straight, slender
trunks to heights of more
than a hundred feet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Reconstruction of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
<br />(after Hirmer)</p>
</div>
<p>Scale trees were so
called because their numerous,
closely set, spirally
arranged leaves left scarred
&ldquo;cushions&rdquo; on the branches
and trunk, making them appear
scaly. Seal trees derived
their name from the
signetlike appearance of
their leaf cushions. The two
best known types belong to the genera <i>Lepidodendron</i>
(scale tree) and <i>Sigillaria</i> (seal tree), and fossils of both
are common in Illinois.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p><i>Lepidodendron</i> had long, slender, somewhat tapering
trunks. Some of the trees reached heights of more than
100 feet and measured more than two feet in basal diameter.
The trunk ended in a spreading crown formed by repeated
dichotomous branching. The leaves were awl-shaped
or linear, ranging from one to 30 inches long.</p>
<p>The leaf cushions of <i>Lepidodendron</i> are diamond-shaped,
longer than broad, and arranged in spiral rows
around the trunk and branches. A different name, <i>Lepidophyllum</i>,
is used for fossils of the long, bladelike
leaf when it is found detached.</p>
<p>Spores were borne in
long cylindrical cones at the
tips of the branches. Those
cones referred, or assigned,
to the genus <i>Lepidostrobus</i>
bore both small spores (microspores)
and large spores
(megaspores) in the same
cones. Those in which only
a large single spore, a
somewhat seedlike structure,
was developed in a
spore sac (sporangium) are
referred to the genus <i>Lepidocarpon</i>.</p>
<p>The rather commonly
found genus <i>Stigmaria</i> comprises
so-called &ldquo;appendages&rdquo;
which, although stemlike
in structure, apparently
served as roots for the
scale and seal trees. These
appendages are identified by irregular spirals of circular
scars (pits) that mark the attachment points of former
rootlets.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="799" />
<p class="pcap">Reconstruction of <i>Sigillaria</i>
<br />(after Hirmer)</p>
</div>
<p><i>Sigillaria</i>, although less common than <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
was widely distributed during the Pennsylvanian Period.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
It differed in growth habit from <i>Lepidodendron</i> in that it
generally had fewer branches and not uncommonly was
unbranched. Some species also possessed a thicker
trunk, with hexagonal to elongate leaf cushions separated
by vertical ribs. The trunk was crowned, in the manner
of the modern palm tree, by a cluster of large, grasslike
leaves.</p>
<p>The detached leaves of <i>Sigillaria</i>,
extremely difficult to distinguish
from <i>Lepidophyllum</i> (leaves
of <i>Lepidodendron</i>), are referred to
the genus <i>Sigillariophyllum</i> if preserved
as compressions and to
<i>Sigillariopsis</i> if preserved as petrifactions.
Unbranched <i>Sigillaria</i>
trunks have been found that are
more than 100 feet long and six feet
in diameter near the base, but the
average height probably was closer
to 50 feet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">Reconstruction of <i>Calamites</i>
<br />(After Hirmer)</p>
</div>
<p>Not all Pennsylvanian trees
were large, however. Small forms
are known, including the important
undergrowth genera <i>Lycopodites</i> and
<i>Selaginellites</i>. In woody types the
trunk consisted of an inner region
of conducting and supporting tissues,
surrounding concentric cortical
layers, and an outer layer of
corklike bark. Although the fossil
impressions of the various bark layers have been given
separate generic names, these are not commonly used.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">SCOURING RUSHES</span>
<br />(<a href="#fig16">Plate 2</a>)</h2>
<p>Although related to the small, inconspicuous horsetails
of today, the ancient scouring rushes of the Pennsylvanian
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Period grew to the size of trees and were among
the most widely distributed plant groups.</p>
<p>Some of these plants attained heights of 40 feet or
more, but the average was closer to 20 feet. The trunks
were jointed and bore a whorl of branches at the joints
(nodes). Their small leaves also grew in whorls at nodes
along the smaller branches. Internodal regions were
ribbed in the same manner as present day horsetails.
Fossils of the trunks are assigned to the genus <i>Calamites</i>
and quite commonly are preserved in sandstone and shale.</p>
<p>The leaf whorls are placed in the genus <i>Annularia</i>.
One form commonly found in Illinois has long, pointed,
needlelike leaves and is given the name <i>Asterophyllites</i>.
<i>Calamostachys</i>, shown on <a href="#fig19">plate 5</a>, is one of the most
common calamite cones.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">SPHENOPHYLLUM</span>
<br />(<a href="#fig16">Plate 2</a>)</h2>
<p>The name <i>Sphenophyllum</i> refers to both stems and
leaves of this extinct genus, which was related to the
scouring rushes&mdash;note its resemblance to <i>Annularia</i>.</p>
<p>A small herbaceous plant, <i>Sphenophyllum</i> formed
much of the swampy undergrowth of the Pennsylvanian
Period and is abundant among Illinois fossils. It had a
slender, ribbed stem bearing whorls of delicate, wedge-shaped
leaves, generally less than three-fourths of an
inch long, attached around the stem in multiples of three.</p>
<p>The cones of this group also are slender, delicate
structures, bearing a number of sporangia, and are correctly
called <i>Bowmanites</i>, although they also have been
called <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i>. These fossil cones frequently
are found in Illinois.</p>
<p><i>Sphenophyllum</i> first appeared during the Devonian
Period, some 300 million years ago, but did not become
abundant until Pennsylvanian time. The genus continued
through the Permian but died out in Triassic time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">FERNS</span>
<br />(Plates <a href="#fig15">1</a> and <a href="#fig17">3</a>)</h2>
<p>True ferns, like those living in today&rsquo;s
woodlands, were common in the
Pennsylvanian forests. Some species
attained heights of 30 to 40 feet. Their
fronds (compound leaves divided into
segments or leaflets) commonly were
five to six feet long.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="400" />
<p class="pcap">Portion of fern
frond showing
sori on lower

</div>
<p>True ferns do not produce cones or
seeds, but spores, which develop in
cases called sporangia. The sporangia
frond showing are attached in clusters (sori) to the
lower side or margins of the leaves.
In modern ferns the sporangia may also
occur on fertile spikes.</p>
<p>The shape and position of the sori are used to identify
modern ferns, but because leaves that bear sori
(&ldquo;fertile&rdquo; leaves) are rare
among fossil specimens, the
number, shape, and attachment
of the leaflets and the
pattern of the veins are more
commonly used for identification.</p>

<p class="pcap">Reconstruction of <i>Megaphyton</i>
<br />(after Hirmer)</p>
</div>
<p>Because fossils of complete
fern plants have not yet been found,
separate names have been adopted
for detached leaves, stems, and
other parts. For example, the fossil
stems of some Pennsylvanian ferns
found in Illinois have been referred
to two genera, <i>Megaphyton</i>, whose
leaf attachment scars are arranged
in two vertical rows, one on either
side of the stem, and <i>Caulopteris</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
whose leaf scars are arranged in a steep spiral that becomes
progressively flatter upward until near the top they
appear to be whorled. When the stem is a petrifaction,
with internal structures preserved, it is called <i>Psaronius</i>.
The fronds are referred to a number of genera, but those
most commonly found in Illinois are <i>Pecopteris</i>, <i>Asterotheca</i>,
and <i>Ptychocarpus</i>.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">SEED FERNS</span>
<br />(<a href="#fig18">Plate 4</a>)</h2>
<p>Seed ferns resembled
true ferns in general,
but they produced
seeds, borne on modified
leaves. Where
spore sacs and seeds
are absent, the leaves
of seed ferns are difficult
to distinguish
from those of spore
ferns, although individual
seed fern leaflets,
called pinnae,
are somewhat larger.</p>

<p>Seed ferns included

the undergrowth and
trees such as <i>Medullosa</i>.
Some tree genera
were very tall,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
with trunks more than two feet in diameter. Unlike the
true ferns, still living today, seed ferns declined steadily
after the close of the Pennsylvanian Period and finally
became extinct during Jurassic time. During Pennsylvanian
time, however, they were much more numerous
and varied than true ferns.</p>

includes circular leaves

<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Pennsylvanian Period for they were distributed throughout
the world. These trees, among the tallest plants of the
time, sometimes grew more than 100 feet high.</p>
<p>The cordaitean trunk was unbranched for three-fourths
of the height of the tree and was topped by dense branches
bearing large, simple, straplike leaves spirally arranged.
The leaves had closely set parallel veins and measured
from half an inch to three feet or more long.</p>
<p>Internally, the structure of the trunks was similar to
that of modern pine trunks. Casts of the pith are referred
to the genus <i>Artisia</i>. The seeds were borne in clusters
on branches in leaf axils.</p>
<p>The <i>Cordaites</i> were major contributors to some coal
beds.</p>

<p>Fossils representing many kinds of plant reproductive
structures are found in Pennsylvanian rocks, but unfortunately
most of them are not attached to any identifiable
part of the parent plant and they cannot be assigned
definitely to a particular plant. Such fossils are referred
to genera and species solely on the basis of their own
characteristics, although, as in other fossil classifications,
such &ldquo;form genera&rdquo; are presumed to be parts of,
or related to, the plants with which they are found in
habitual association.</p>
<p>A few such fossils, fairly common in Illinois, are
illustrated on <a href="#fig19">plate 5</a> to show their general shape and
size. When attached to an identifiable leaf or leaflet,
the seed is referred to as the seed of that leaf genus.</p>
<p>For example, <i>Holcospermum</i>, a radially symmetrical
seed with ribs and grooves, <i>Codonotheca</i>, a stalked,
spore-bearing, lobed &ldquo;cup,&rdquo; and <i>Neuropterocarpus</i>, a
flask-shaped seed with longitudinal ribs and grooves,
all have been associated with <i>Neuropteris</i>, a leaf genus.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">COLLECTING AREAS FOR PENNSYLVANIAN PLANTS</span>
<br />Northern Illinois</h2>
<p>Plant fossils can be found in almost any northern Illinois
area where Pennsylvanian rocks are exposed (see
<a href="#Page_37">back cover</a>), but in some places they are much better
preserved and more numerous than in others. Most of the
well known collecting areas and a few of the lesser known
ones are discussed below. Even though some of the localities
were discovered many years ago, they may indicate
areas that are still favorable for collecting.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Mazon Creek Area</h3>
<p>Of all the fossils that have been found in Illinois,
the most famous are the plant remains from the world-renowned
Mazon Creek area in the northeastern part of
the state. In this area in Grundy and Will Counties,
plant fossils are found in ironstone concretions in the
lower part of the Francis Creek Shale directly overlying
the Colchester (No. 2) Coal.</p>
<p>Fossils were discovered in outcrops along Mazon
Creek more than a century ago and collections later were
made from scores of conical spoil heaps at underground
mines. After coal stripping began in the 1920&rsquo;s, great
numbers of specimens were collected.</p>
<p>In the stripping operations, the concretion-bearing
beds are commonly the last to be placed on the spoil
heap. Weathering softens and removes the shales and
leaves the nodules concentrated on the surface.
Each season brings a new crop of concretions to
the surface.</p>

</div>
<p>The concretions generally are oval to elongate
and range from less than an inch to a foot or
more in maximum dimension. Only about one nodule in
ten contains plant remains.</p>
<p>Approximately 25 to 30 species have been found in
this region. The productivity of the area was shown by
George Langford, Sr., a well known midwestern fossil
collector. He and his son split about 250 thousand concretions
during a 140-day period and obtained some 25
thousand plant specimens. Fine specimens still can be
collected in a few hours.</p>
<p>The plant collecting localities in Will and Grundy
Counties along Mazon Creek, four to six miles southeast
of the town of Morris, were the first to be well known.
Ferns are especially abundant. Fossils of insects, crustaceans,
worms, and salamanders also have been found.
Collecting conditions vary considerably from season to
season, and fossils are not as easily obtained there as
from the strip-mine spoil heaps.</p>
<p>Fossiliferous concretions may be found in a number
of the strip mines in the area, although probably most
have come from the Northern Illinois Coal Corporation
mine between the towns of Braidwood and Wilmington.</p>
<p>In earlier years good collections were made from the
spoil heaps of underground mines. Especially notable
are the mine dumps of the Wilmington Star No. 7 mine,
2&frac14; miles west of Coal City, and Skinner No. 2 mine,
two miles northeast of Braidwood.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Morris on the northwest
edge of the Mazon Creek area, fossil ferns have
been found along the north side of the Illinois
River and in the banks of the Illinois-Michigan
Canal. About a mile north in an area of strip
mining, fossil-bearing concretions have been
found in shale and irregular sandstone layers.</p>

<p>Fossils in concretions also have been collected from
a shaly limestone at the south end of the Kankakee River
bridge along the Grundy and Will county line.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Bureau County</h3>
<p>Some 40 miles downstream from Morris on the Illinois
River, plant fossils have been discovered in waste
from the Spring Valley Coal Co. mine 1. They also are
found in black shale below the LaSalle Limestone in a
small gully in the southwest part of town, but at neither
place are they plentiful.</p>
<h3 id="c14">Knox County</h3>
<p>A notable number and variety of well preserved
plant fossils have been produced from
a locality along Court Creek in East Galesburg.
The Rock Island (No. 1) Coal is mined in the
area and the fossils appear to have come from
the shale overlying it.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12a.jpg" id="ncfig7" alt="uncaptioned" width="163" height="400" />
</div>
<p>Fossil plants also have been found in
shales above the Colchester (No. 2) Coal in the vicinity
of DeLong and with the Herrin (No. 6) Coal in mines
southeast of Victoria.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Mercer and Warren Counties</h3>
<p>In northern Warren and southern Mercer Counties the
sandstone underlying the Rock Island (No. 1) Coal is
termed the &ldquo;Stigmarian&rdquo; sandstone because of numerous
siliceous casts found in the bed. Many of the fossils
have been collected from an old mine dump and from ravines
along the Edwards River northeast of Aledo.</p>
<p>A number of representatives of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, <i>Neuropteris</i>,
and <i>Annularia</i> have been collected from ironstone
concretions occurring in shale that overlies the
Colchester (No. 2) Coal about three miles southwest of
Alexis. They were found in a gully about a third of a
mile southeast of Center School.</p>

<p>In the same general area but about three miles due
south of Alexis, fossil plants also may be found in the
clay pits of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company and the
Northwestern Clay Manufacturing Company.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Fulton County</h3>
<p>Although there are numerous isolated
occurrences of plant fossils throughout the
extensive strip mines and outcrops in Fulton
County, no exceptionally good collecting localities
have been discovered.</p>
<p>Fern and cordaitean leaves have been collected
along Mill Creek about a mile northeast
of Pleasantview where the fossils occur in the
shale overlying the Babylon Coal. In the same general
area, impressions and casts of <i>Stigmaria</i>, <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
and <i>Cordaites</i> have been found in the Babylon Sandstone.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" id="ncfig9" alt="uncaptioned" width="251" height="401" />
</div>
<p>Three miles north of Pleasantview, a quarter of a
mile northwest of Union School, several species of leaves
have been collected from the Browning Sandstone where
it is exposed in a roadcut.</p>
<p>Farther east, there is a fairly good locality in the
stream bluff of Kerton Creek about 3&frac14; miles north and
a quarter of a mile west of Bluff City. There the plants
are found about 18 feet below a coal bed.</p>
<p>Numerous fern impressions also are found in shale
beds above the Herrin (No. 6) Coal along the Middle
Branch of Copperas Creek, six miles west of Glasford.
Other specimens may be found in these beds elsewhere
in the area.</p>
<h3 id="c17">McDonough County</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13c.jpg" id="ncfig10" alt="uncaptioned" width="267" height="401" />
</div>
<p>In some of the small underground
mines near Colchester, the shale overlying
the Colchester (No. 2) Coal contains
ironstone concretions similar to
those from northeastern Illinois. More than 50 species
of plant fossils have been reported, but they were collected
many years ago from spoil heaps at the mines.
Beds of the same age crop out widely in other localities
in western Illinois and may contain plant fossils.</p>

<h3 id="c18">Vermilion County</h3>
<p>In outcrops about three miles below Georgetown on
the Little Vermilion River, a number of fossil plant species
and one insect species have been collected from
shales overlying the Herrin (No. 6) Coal, locally called
the Grape Creek Coal. The fossils occur in concretions
much like those from Mazon Creek.</p>
<p>An occasional stem replacement or impression is
found in the concretionary shale above the No. 7 Coal
in the strip mine area west of Hillery. In fact, isolated
fragmentary plant specimens are fairly common in the
Danville mining area, but no especially productive localities
have come to light.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Other Northern Illinois Localities</h3>
<p>In addition to the counties listed above, a number of
others have produced plant fossils. For example, there
are records of plant fossils found southeast of Franklin
in Morgan County, at Neelys in Peoria County, and at a
number of places in the southern and western parts of
Rock Island County. Local exploration is certain to turn
up numerous other collecting places at present unknown.</p>

<h3 id="c21">Lawrence County</h3>
<p>Near the Lawrence-Richland county line,
not far from the towns of Berryville and Calhoun,
there is an area rich in the fossil petrifactions
called &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; in which cellular structures of stems
and roots generally are well preserved.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Saline, Pope, and Johnson Counties</h3>
<p>Saline County has more recorded plant fossil localities
than any other southern Illinois county. Fossil
plant collecting localities are isolated but numerous in
the area southwest of Harrisburg. Mine dumps, such as
in the area five or six miles northwest of Eddyville, and
many outcrops are available throughout the region. The
fossils probably are associated with the Murphysboro,
Delwood, Willis, Reynoldsburg, and Battery Rock Coals.</p>
<p>One especially good collecting area is on the south
tributary of the East Branch Cedar Creek about 6&frac12; miles
south of Stonefort. The fossils are found in six feet of
shale overlying the Battery Rock Coal horizon.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Perry and Jackson Counties</h3>
<p>Near DuQuoin and Murphysboro, a variety of well
preserved plant fossils has been collected from shales
overlying both the Herrin (No. 6) Coal and the Murphysboro
Coal. Nearly all have come from shaft mines that
are not easily accessible to the collector.</p>
<p>One currently good outcrop locality for collecting
plant fossils from the shale above the Murphysboro Coal
is just southeast of Murphysboro.</p>
<h3 id="c24">Other Southern Illinois Localities</h3>
<p>Other collecting localities have been recorded west
of McLeansboro in Hamilton County, northwest of Mt.
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Vernon in Jefferson County, near Grayville in White County,
and in the Friendsville area of Wabash County. There
is no doubt that careful search will turn up many more.</p>
<p>Almost anywhere in the large coal producing areas of
southern Illinois plant fossils can be found either in spoil
heaps or in outcrops along stream, road, and railroad
cuts. The thick Pennsylvanian sandstones that crop out
in a belt extending through Gallatin, Saline, Williamson,
and Jackson Counties generally contain compressions or
replacements of trunks or other woody plant parts.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">SUGGESTIONS FOR COLLECTING PENNSYLVANIAN PLANTS</span></h2>
<h3 id="c26">Where to Look for Plant Fossils</h3>
<p>Pennsylvanian plants are most commonly found in
shales directly overlying coal beds. The shales are believed
to be of nonmarine origin like the coals and may
contain fossils either in ironstone concretions or on the
bedding planes. The shale layers as well as the concretions
should be examined. Where the bed directly
overlying the coal consists of black slaty shale or limestone
containing marine fossils, plant remains are rarely
abundant or well preserved.</p>
<p>Beneath the coals there generally is an underclay
that is interpreted as the material in which the coal forest
grew. The underclay is in turn underlain by a sandstone,
and both are believed to be mostly nonmarine.
Stigmarian axes and &ldquo;roots&rdquo; are common in many of the
underclays. Plant fossils are common in the sandstone
but generally are poorly preserved, except in the local
shaly lenses.</p>
<p>The best place to look for plant fossils in northern
Illinois, except for the strip mines of the Mazon Creek
area, is probably in the spoil heaps from shaft mines.
The Colchester (No. 2) Coal has been extensively mined
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
by the longwall method. This technique causes the mine
roof to settle when the coal is removed, and the haulage
ways are kept open by removing the roof shale. Inasmuch
as the roof shale is the Francis Creek Formation of the
Mazon Creek area, it may contain abundant plant-bearing
concretions. The shale is not everywhere fossiliferous,
however, and in many spoil heaps fossils are rare.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="244" />
<p class="pcap">Tools for Collecting</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c27">Collecting Equipment</h3>
<p>The collector of plant fossils should have the following
tools and equipment:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&#9312; Hammer&mdash;a bricklayer&rsquo;s hammer will work well.</p>
<p class="t0">&#9313; One or two chisels, preferably one large and one small.</p>
<p class="t0">&#9314; Knapsack or basket in which to carry specimens.</p>
<p class="t0">&#9315; Newspapers and a roll of tissue paper for protecting fragile specimens.</p>
<p class="t0">&#9316; Pencil and paper for labeling specimens and making notes about the collecting locality from which the fossils came. Much of the value of a particular fossil lies in knowing precisely where it was found and the layer of rock it came from.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h3 id="c28">Rules of Courtesy</h3>
<p>When entering a collecting area every collector
should observe several rules carefully:</p>
<p>&#9312; For your own protection get permission to enter
and collect on any private property. Such action also
will help to assure your welcome if you wish to come
back again.</p>
<p>&#9313; Leave the gates exactly as you find them, open
or closed. Do not climb fences that may break or sag
under your weight; crawl under or go around.</p>
<p>&#9314; Don&rsquo;t litter, even though far from any house or
other buildings. Do not disturb the owner&rsquo;s equipment,
stock, or planted areas.</p>
<h3 id="c29">Handling Specimens</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" id="ncfig13" alt="uncaptioned" width="500" height="578" />
</div>
<p>The most successful way to
split an ironstone concretion is to
set it on edge, long axis horizontal,
on any fairly large rock and
strike the upper edge with the hammer.
If the concretion is one that
developed around a fossil nucleus,
it generally will split along the
plane of weakness, revealing the
fossil. Sometimes one side of the
concretion will break off in the
middle, in which case the remainder
should be tapped firmly but gently
on the upper edge until the fossil
is completely uncovered. Pieces of the broken half should
be glued together neatly with waterproof cement so that
the entire specimen can be retained.</p>
<p>Fossils embedded in shale may be recovered by the
same method or by repeatedly tapping a chisel inserted
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
along the bedding plane. If the fossil is exposed, the
matrix can be chiseled away by slow, painstaking effort.</p>
<p>The usual method
of wrapping plant-bearing
nodules is to
place the end of a
sheet of newspaper
between the two
halves of the nodule,
fold the paper over
the nodule, and roll
it up in the sheet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="239" />
<p class="pcap">How to Wrap a Fossiliferous Concretion</p>
</div>
<p>When several localities
are visited in one collecting trip, the fossils from
each should be kept separate; cloth bags are convenient
for this purpose. Notes about the locality should be put
in the same bag as fossils from that locality so that there
is no possibility of confusion.</p>
<p>Some fossils are so fragile or porous that they should
be covered with a hardening protective coat of crude gum
arabic solution. (Refined gum arabic will not serve.)
This may be applied with a fine brush in successive layers,
or sturdier fossils may be dipped in it.</p>
<p>When a fossil is so delicate that the surface tension
of the gum arabic solution causes the fossil to &ldquo;spread,&rdquo;
celluloid (not plastic) dissolved in acetone should be
substituted. Before this solution is used, the specimen
must be completely dry or the coating will become cloudy
or opaque.</p>
<p>If the specimen is pyritized, it should be sprayed
with lacquer or shellac to prevent disintegration. If
these protective sprays are used they must be applied to
dry specimens during dry weather or the coating will remain
sticky.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
